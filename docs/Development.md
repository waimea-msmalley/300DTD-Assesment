## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 21/05/24

Starting Database Sketch

I began looking at what my final database would look like, and after a few different iterations, I landed on this. Each user can have many cars on the sight.

> User had no questions about the layout of the database, was happy with the layout, and all the features it offers.

I left the Database sketch how it was, since it would cater to the end-users needs as is.

### 23/05/24

Sketched out how I intend the website will run

Below is a all the actions I will aim to include in the functionality of my Website, including all the pages, their function, and all the options that the users will have when accessing the pages.
![Alt text](images/sketch.png)

> End User was happy with how it looked, and said he couldn't wait to see a working version.

My end user gave me no feedback to act on.

### 24/05/24

Started on Website Design using Figma

This is the first draft of what the front end of the home page of my website will look like. I will most definitely add to this, but I will get the end-user to give me tips on what to add.

> End user wanted a search bar so they could search for cars that was, instead of jst scrolling in hope of finding the car they want. He also said that a darker colour scheme with highlights would be better than the black, white and grey.

Search bar was added, I shall look at colours later down the track.

Finished Figma Draft

I finished a first draft on all the pages in my website.
![Alt text](images/figmav2.png)

> End user is very happy with how the draft is layed out, and how all the components function with each other. I let the end user navigate around the wesite himself, and he didn't have any issues with the UI or Functionality.

I think I will need to make the navigation tab a little larger in the coded version. But other than that, no immediate changes will be made.

### 07/06/24

Colour Scheme

This is the scheme I liked the most after testing some out. I shall see what my end user says. Having a colour scheme that the end user likes in important factor for the Aesthetic heristic.

> End user was much happier with the darker colour as apposed to the white, grey and black. They were also a big fan of the green.

I have changed the colour scheme on all the pages to the darker scheme as the end user requested.

Font

I had a look at all the diffrent fonts that Figma has integrated into their system. I like the font Jaldi for my website. It's Clear, not fancy and easy to read.

![alt text](images/newfont.png)

> My end user also likes the Jaldi Font, for the same reasons I do, commenting on the fact that its not fancy, and hard on his eyes.

I will use the Jaldi font when I start coding the website.

Old 'Inter' Font

### 11/06/24

Created Database

I used the template that I made in the first development log, and created it in MySQL. It has all the tables and columns that I planned, and it looks great.

Tables:

I also added some test data to the 'users' and 'cars' tables, and they are all working as expected.

> User says this is a good start, and can't wait to give feedback when the site has more substance. 

### 12/07/24

Colour Scheme (CSS)


I had a play around with the style sheet. Seeing how the green looked and what needed to be changed to make it work with the page.

Before Styles
![Alt text](images/loggedout.png)

After Styles
![Alt text](images/afterstyles.png)

> Good start. Definitely needs some work with the buttons and the spacing between some text.

Upon editing, I found out that on a light themed device, the background of the web site also inherits that light colour theme(How user Feedback was acted upon.)

Before fix:


After fix: (Still white device theme)

### 15/07/24

Form for Adding Cars


I completed the form that allows the user to add cars to sell. and looks neat. the car information is added, and shows up on the home page as intended.

About to add car in
