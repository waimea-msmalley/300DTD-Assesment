## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 21/05/24

Starting Database Sketch

I began looking at what my final database would look like, and after a few different iterations, I landed on this. Each user can have many cars on the sight.

> User had no questions about the layout of the database, was happy with the layout, and all the features it offers.

I left the Database sketch how it was, since it would cater to the end-users needs as is.

### 23/05/24

Sketched out how I intend the website will run

Below is a all the actions I will aim to include in the functionality of my Website, including all the pages, their function, and all the options that the users will have when accessing the pages.

> End User was happy with how it looked, and siad he couldn't wait to see a working version.

My end user gave me no feedback to act on.

### 24/05/24

Started on Website Design using Figma

This is the first draft of what the front end of the home page of my website will look like. I will most definitely add to this, but I will get the end-user to give me tips on what to add.

> End user wanted a search bar so they could search for cars that was, instead of jst scrolling in hope of finding the car they want. He also said that a darker colour scheme with highlights would be better than the black, white and grey.

Search bar was added, I shall look at colours later down the track.

Finished Figma Draft

I finished a first draft on all the pages in my website.
![Alt text](images/figmav2.png)

> End user is very happy with how the draft is layed out, and how all the components function with each other. I let the end user navigate around the wesite himself, and he didn't have any issues with the UI or Functionality.

I think I will need to make the navigation tab a little larger in the coded version. But other than that, no immediate changes will be made.

### 07/06/24

Colour Scheme

This is the scheme I liked the most after testing some out. I shall see what my end user says.
![Alt text](images/colour.png)

> End user was much happier with the darker colour as apposed to the white, grey and black. They were also a big fan of the green.

I have changed the colour scheme on all the pages to the darker scheme as the end user requested.

Font

I had a look at all the diffrent fonts that Figma has integrated into their system. I like the font Jaldi for my website. It's Clear, not fancy and easy to read.

> My end user also likes the Jaldi Font, for the same reasons I do, commenting on the fact that its not fancy, and hard on his eyes.

I will use the Jaldi font when I start coding the website.

Old 'Inter' Font

### 11/06/24

Created Database

I used the template that I made in the first development log, and created it in MySQL. It has all the tables and columns that I planned, and it looks great.

Tables:

I also added some test data to the 'users' and 'cars' tables, and they are all working as expected.
