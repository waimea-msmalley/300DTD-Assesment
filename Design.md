## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Investment Vehicles are slowly going on the decline, and finding them is becoming more and more difficult, so being able to have all things investment vehicles in one place whether it be just showing them of, or looking to buy or sell, will be ideal for the car enthusiast community.

### End-User Requirements

My end users will be car enthusiasts and car investors. For enthusiasts, it could be just browsing the catalog to look at the cars, for the sake of looking at the cars. And them we have the investors, who are actually looking for cars to buy and sell. We need to be able to browse through the cars that other investors have added, and be able to send a message with an offer to buy the cars that investors have listed as "For Sale".
