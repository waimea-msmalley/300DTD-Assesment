## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Investment Vehicles are slowly going on the decline, and finding them is becoming more and more difficult, so being able to have all things investment vehicles in one place, for buying or selling, will be ideal for the car investment community.

### End-User Requirements

**Car Investors** are people who buy old/classic cars knowing that over the period they have them, they can sell them for more money that they bought is for. These **investors** need to sell their cars they have, and after they have sold them will want to buy a new one. They will need to see a list of cars that are available to them, and be about to have a way to contact the buyer with an offer for a car they want.

### Proposed Solution

My proposed solution to this is a website, where investors can view all the cars available to them on a home page. They should be able to view a photo of the the car they want, and it be linked to a page with more information about the car, including a way to contact the owner with an offer. 

**Investors** should be able too:
- Make an account on the website.
- Be able to sign in and out of the website.
- Be able to list cars, with a photo and information about said car.
- When viewing the car, be able to send a message to the owner, asking questions, or making an offer.
- Each user will have an inbox where they can receive these questions and offers on their vehicles.

## Relevant Implications

### Functionality Implications

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

It is important to have a website that works, well and is easy to use, since a good number of my end users will be older people, who won't have much experience with tech.

To cater for those that are less experienced with tech using this website, I will make sure that navigation throughout my website will be easy. I will insure this by using:
- Have the design of the website simple and minimalistic
- Make Page transitions smooth
- Make sure to test for bugs constantly

### Aesthetic Implications

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

Making a website look appealing one of, if not **the** most important things to consider when making a website. I plan to have my website very simplistic. With a light colour scheme, and simplistic font.

Some things I will need to consider relating to this heuristic are:
- Having a good colour scheme
- Getting a good font that works well with said colour scheme
- Having the content of the page laid out well

### End-User Implications

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).
