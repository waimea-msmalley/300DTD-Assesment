Project Name: **MotiveAuto**

Project Author: **Myles Smalley**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Investment Vehicles are slowly going on the decline, and finding them is becoming more and more difficult, so being able to have all things investment vehicles in one place, for buying or selling, will be ideal for the car investment community.

### End-User Requirements

**Car Investors** are people who buy old/classic cars knowing that over the period they have them, they can sell them for more money that they bought is for. These **investors** need to sell their cars they have, and after they have sold them will want to buy a new one. They will need to see a list of cars that are available to them, and be about to have a way to contact the buyer with an offer for a car they want.

### Proposed Solution

My proposed solution to this is a website, where investors can view all the cars available to them on a home page. They should be able to view a photo of the the car they want, and it be linked to a page with more information about the car, including a way to contact the owner with an offer. 

**Investors** should be able too:
- Make an account on the website.
- Be able to sign in and out of the website.
- Be able to list cars, with a photo and information about said car.
- When viewing the car, be able to send a message to the owner, asking questions, or making an offer.
- Each user will have an inbox where they can receive these questions and offers on their vehicles.

## Relevant Implications

### Functionality Implications

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

It is important to have a website that works, well and is easy to use, since a good number of my end users will be older people, who won't have much experience with tech.

To cater for those that are less experienced with tech using this website, I will make sure that navigation throughout my website will be easy. I will insure this by using:
- Have the design of the website simple and minimalistic
- Make Page transitions smooth
- Make sure to test for bugs constantly

### Aesthetic Implications

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

Making a website look appealing one of, if not **the** most important things to consider when making a website. I plan to have my website very simplistic. With a light colour scheme, and simplistic font.

Some things I will need to consider relating to this heuristic are:
- Having a good colour scheme
- Getting a good font that works well with said colour scheme
- Having the content of the page laid out well

### End-User Implications

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

This implication is relevant because people of varying adult ages will be using this site, and having a UI that is easy to use and be usable for all the ages that might use it. Making sure the site appeals to that target audience is important as well. Using cool, more masculine type colours to make sure the sight isn't repulsive to the target audience.

Things I will need to consider moving forward is: 
- Making the UX very easy, and not complex.
- Use cool, masculine type colours
- Make sure the site is appealing

### Accessibility Implications

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

Making sure this website is accessible for all uses is a must. To insure this, I will make sure that the site is comparable with both personal computers, and touchscreen devices such at tablets and mobile phones. I will also make sure that my website doesn't rely on heavily on red/green colours so those who are colour-blind won't be impaired while using my site.

Things I will need to consider moving forward for this implication is: 
- Make site usable on all devices
- Accessible for the colour-blind
- Have good colours and fonts.

### Privacy Implications

The privacy implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to protecting the privacy of end-users and their data.

This website needs to have an account system, and be able to log in and out successfully. with thins we need to have some kind of password security to insure the safety of the end-users data. 

Things I will need to consider moving forward for this implication is: 
- Hashing users passwords for security purposes
- Making an account should be simple and easy

-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### Match Between System and the Real World

Use words, images and concepts that are familiar to the user.
Reflect real-world experiences.

Make the UI similar to other browsing/shopping apps to insure familiarity.

Things I will need to consider moving forward for this implication is: 
- Using drop-down menus
- Using check boxes
- Having an image to show the car

###  Consistency and Standards

Where possible, stick to conventions for UI elements and layout.
In general, place menus at the top or left-side, use standard icons for home, etc.



Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this principle.

### Help and Documentation

Try to create a system that doesn't need documentation, but if it is required, keep it short and easy to access.

Replace this text with an explanation of why the principle is relevant to this particular project.

## Final System Design

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.


-------------------------------------------------

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.


-------------------------------------------------

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
